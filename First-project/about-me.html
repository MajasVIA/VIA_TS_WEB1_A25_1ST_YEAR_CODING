                        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Maja Hovedskou</strong>. I'm studying software engineering and have a 
                        big interest in both programming and digital design.<br> I live in Slimminge, Sweden, where I spend 
                        most of my time learning, coding, and working on different web and Java projects.</p>

                        <p>I have a background in electronics and programming, and I really enjoy creating things that 
                        combine logic and creativity. I like building websites,<br> experimenting with code, and learning 
                        new technologies that can make everyday life more fun.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not studying or coding, I like cooking, especially Italian food, reading books, learning 
                        about new stuff, going for walks in<br> 
                        nature, and spending time with my family. This website is where I collect my work, studies, and 
                        projects that I've enjoyed creating.</p>
