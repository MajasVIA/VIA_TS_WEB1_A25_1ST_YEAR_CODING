<!--
In CSS, inheritance controls what happens 
when no value is specified for a property on an 
element.

CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

- inherited properties, which by default are set 
to the computed value of the parent element
- non-inherited properties, which by default are 
set to initial value of the property 

----------------------------------------------
Inherited properties â€” simple explanation:

When an element doesnâ€™t have its own value for 
a certain CSS property,
it inherits that value from its parent element 
(the element itâ€™s inside).

ðŸ’¡ Example:
If you set color: blue; on the <body>,
then all the text inside the body will also be 
red â€” unless you change it somewhere else.

Only the root element (<html>) gets the browserâ€™s
default (initial) values.

Example: 
CSS:
-->

p {
  color: blue;
}

<HTML>:
<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> 
in it.</p>

<!--The words "emphasized text" will appear blue,
since the em element has inherited the value of 
the color property from the p element.-->

----------------------------------------------

<!--Non-inherited properties â€” simple explanation

When an element doesnâ€™t have its own value for a 
non-inherited property,
it does not take the value from its parent.
Instead, it uses the default (initial) value that 
the browser gives it.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
The border property is not inherited.
So if you add a border to the <body>,
the elements inside it (like <p> or <h1>) won't 
automatically get a border too.

css: 
p {
  border: medium solid;
}

-->
HTML: 
<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> 
in it.</p>

<!--
The words "emphasized text" will not have another 
border (since the initial value of border-style 
is none). -->

---------------------------------------------------

<!--
The inherit keyword: 
allows authors to explicitly specify inheritance. 
It works on both inherited and non-inherited 
properties.

You can control inheritance for all properties at 
once using the all shorthand property, which 
applies its value to all properties. 
For example:

CSS:
p {
  all: revert;
  font-size: 200%;
  font-weight: bold;
}

This reverts the style of the paragraphs' 
font property to the user agent's default 
unless a user stylesheet exists, in which case 
that is used instead. Then it doubles the font 
size and applies a font-weight of "bold".

<!--
Overriding inheritance, an example
Using our previous example with border, 
if we explicitly set the inheritance with inherit,
we get the following:

CSS:
p {
  border: medium solid;
}

em {
  border: inherit;
}

HTML: -->

<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> in 
it.</p>

<!--We can see here another border around the 
word "emphasized text".-->
